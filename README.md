# APstorage BLE — Home Assistant Custom Integration

A Home Assistant custom integration for the **APstorage ELT-12 PCS** communicating over **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**.

Designed to work with an **ESPHome Bluetooth proxy** placed near the PCS.

## Status

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| HA integration structure | ✅ Complete |
| Config flow (auto-discover + manual MAC) | ✅ Complete |
| BLE connection / GATT session | ✅ Complete |
| Blufi handshake + encrypted local-data query | ✅ **Working** |
| Active + fallback periodic polling | ✅ **Working** |
| Sensor entity platform | ✅ **Working** |

## Implemented Sensors

The following sensors are implemented in the integration.

### Confirmed working on current test device

- ✅ **Battery State of Charge** (`%`)
- ✅ **Battery Voltage** (`V`)
- ✅ **Battery Current** (`A`)
- ✅ **Battery Power** (`W`)
- ✅ **Battery Temperature** (`°C`)
- ✅ **Inverter Temperature** (`°C`)
- ✅ **System State** (raw state code/string)
- ✅ **Grid Power** (`W`)
- ✅ **PV Power** (`W`)
- ✅ **Load Power** (`W`)

### Implemented with fallback behavior

- ✅ **Battery Charged Energy** (`kWh`)
- ✅ **Battery Discharged Energy** (`kWh`)

Notes:
- If the device payload exposes true cumulative totals, those are used directly.
- If totals are missing (common on some firmware), the integration derives estimated kWh from `battery_power × elapsed_time`.
- Estimated counters reset on HA/integration restart.

### Defined but may remain unavailable (firmware/payload dependent)

- ⚠️ **Grid Voltage** (`V`)
- ⚠️ **Grid Current** (`A`)
- ⚠️ **Grid Frequency** (`Hz`)
- ⚠️ **PV Voltage** (`V`)
- ⚠️ **PV Current** (`A`)
- ⚠️ **Load Voltage** (`V`)
- ⚠️ **Load Current** (`A`)

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS.
2. Install "APstorage BLE".
3. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/apstorage_ble/` into your HA `config/custom_components/` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

---

## Setup

1. Make sure your ESPHome Bluetooth proxy is configured and connected to HA.
2. Power on the PCS (`PCS_B050XXXXXXXX`, MAC `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`).
3. In HA go to **Settings → Devices & Services**.
4. The PCS should be auto-discovered.  Click **Configure** and confirm.
5. If not auto-discovered, click **Add Integration**, search for **APstorage BLE**, and enter the MAC address manually.

## Protocol Notes

The integration currently polls the PCS using a Blufi-based encrypted local-data flow.
Current implementation status is best reflected in the sensor matrix above.

If you are working with a different PCS firmware variant, capture logs and compare payload keys before assuming parity.

## Device info

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Device name | `PCS_B050XXXXXXXX` |
| Bluetooth MAC | `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` |
| Protocol | BLE GATT (custom service) |
| Connection | Active (polled every 30 s) |
