# APstorage BLE — Home Assistant Custom Integration

A Home Assistant custom integration for the **APstorage ELT-12 PCS** communicating over **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**.

Designed to work with an **ESPHome Bluetooth proxy** placed near the PCS.

## Status

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| HA integration structure | ✅ Complete |
| Config flow (auto-discover + manual MAC) | ✅ Complete |
| BLE connection / GATT session | ✅ Complete |
| Blufi handshake + encrypted local-data query | ✅ **Working** |
| Active + fallback periodic polling | ✅ **Working** |
| Sensor entity platform | ✅ **Working** |

## Implemented Sensors

The following sensors are implemented in the integration.

### Confirmed working on current test device

- ✅ **Battery State of Charge** (`%`)
- ✅ **Battery Voltage** (`V`)
- ✅ **Battery Current** (`A`)
- ✅ **Battery Power** (`W`)
- ✅ **Battery Temperature** (`°C`)
- ✅ **Inverter Temperature** (`°C`)
- ✅ **System State** (raw state code/string)
- ✅ **Grid Power** (`W`)
- ✅ **PV Power** (`W`)
- ✅ **Load Power** (`W`)

### Implemented with fallback behavior

- ✅ **Battery Charged Energy** (`kWh`)
- ✅ **Battery Discharged Energy** (`kWh`)

Notes:
- If the device payload exposes true cumulative totals, those are used directly.
- If totals are missing (common on some firmware), the integration derives estimated kWh from `battery_power × elapsed_time`.
- Estimated counters reset on HA/integration restart.

### Defined but may remain unavailable (firmware/payload dependent)

- ⚠️ **Grid Voltage** (`V`)
- ⚠️ **Grid Current** (`A`)
- ⚠️ **Grid Frequency** (`Hz`)
- ⚠️ **PV Voltage** (`V`)
- ⚠️ **PV Current** (`A`)
- ⚠️ **Load Voltage** (`V`)
- ⚠️ **Load Current** (`A`)

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS.
2. Install "APstorage BLE".
3. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/apstorage_ble/` into your HA `config/custom_components/` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

---

## Setup

1. Make sure your ESPHome Bluetooth proxy is configured and connected to HA.
2. Power on the PCS (`PCS_B050XXXXXXXX`, MAC `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`).
3. In HA go to **Settings → Devices & Services**.
4. The PCS should be auto-discovered.  Click **Configure** and confirm.
5. If not auto-discovered, click **Add Integration**, search for **APstorage BLE**, and enter the MAC address manually.

---

## Protocol Notes

The integration currently polls the PCS using a Blufi-based encrypted local-data flow.
Current implementation status is best reflected in the sensor matrix above.

If you are working with a different PCS firmware variant, capture logs and compare payload keys before assuming parity.

## Device info

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Device name | `PCS_B050XXXXXXXX` |
| Bluetooth MAC | `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` |
| Protocol | BLE GATT (custom service) |
| Connection | Active (polled every 30 s) |

## Release Notes

### v0.1.1

- Fixed `Battery Flow State` in Home Assistant to reflect live APstorage battery direction.
- Corrected APstorage sign convention handling: positive battery power/current now maps to `Discharging`, negative maps to `Charging`.
- Updated coordinator flow-state resolution to prioritize live telemetry so the entity no longer stays on `Charging` while discharging.

### v0.1.0

- Fixed `Battery Flow State` reporting being stuck on `Charging` for some devices.
- Live battery telemetry (`battery_power`/`battery_current`) now takes precedence over `essStatus` when determining charge/discharge direction.
- Added debug logging when `essStatus` and live telemetry disagree, to help firmware-specific diagnostics.

### v0.0.37

- Added a new `Battery Flow State` enum sensor with values `Charging`, `Discharging`, and `Holding`.
- Implemented app-compatible battery flow mapping from `essStatus` (`0` -> `Discharging`, `1` -> `Charging`, otherwise `Holding`).
- Added fallback battery flow detection from battery power/current when `essStatus` is not present.
- `System State` now maps key numeric modes to labels (`1` -> `Self-consumption`, `3` -> `Advanced mode`).

### v0.0.36

- Improved daily energy reliability for charging/discharging counters.
- Daily counters now support partial direct totals (charged or discharged) from firmware payloads.
- Fallback integration now updates missing sides instead of skipping all daily energy updates.
- Improved direction handling when battery current and power signs disagree.
